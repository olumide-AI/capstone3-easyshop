      src/main/resources/application.properties
      ```
      Example:
      ```
      db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/easyshop_db
      db.username=root
      db.password=yourpassword
      ```

3. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.easyshop.Main"
    ```

5. **Test the Application**:
    - Use Postman to interact with your APIs or directly use the console interface.
    - Import the prepared Postman collection for quick testing:
        - [EasyShop Postman Collection](./postman/EasyShop.postman_collection.json)

6. **Running Unit Tests**
    - This project includes JUnit tests covering key functionality like services and DAOs.
    - Run all tests with Maven:
      ```bash
      mvn test
      ```
    - Browse the test source files here:
        - [Unit Tests Folder](./src/test/java)

## Running the Live Server & Using Developer Tools

To preview the frontend of EasyShop with live updates:

1. **Install Live Server**
    - If you‚Äôre using **Visual Studio Code**, install the ‚ÄúLive Server‚Äù extension from the Extensions marketplace.

2. **Start the Live Server**
    - Open your project folder in VS Code.
    - Right-click on `index.html` (or your main HTML file) and select **Open with Live Server**.
    - Your browser should open automatically at [http://127.0.0.1:5500](http://127.0.0.1:5500) or [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500).
    - Any changes to your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript will refresh the page automatically.

3. **Using Developer Tools**
    - Open your browser‚Äôs Developer Tools:
        - **Chrome/Edge**: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac).
    - Key tabs for debugging:
        - **Elements**: Inspect and modify HTML/CSS.
        - **Console**: View logs and error messages.
        - **Network**: Monitor API requests and responses.
        - **Sources**: Set breakpoints and debug JavaScript.

**Note:**
- For detailed installation steps on each tool (Java, IntelliJ, Git, MySQL, Postman), refer to your Year Up Software Installation Guide or the official documentation linked above.
- For a consistent development experience, it‚Äôs recommended to use **Google Chrome** as your browser.

## Highlighted Code

One of the most interesting parts of working on EasyShop was learning and implementing **Mockito** for unit testing. This code snippet might not seem mind-blowing, but it represents my curiosity to learn and my commitment to writing safe, maintainable code. Writing tests like this helped me understand mocking, verifying behavior, and building confidence in my application logic.

I learned Mockito by practicing with tutorials and watching a course on LinkedIn Learning:  
[Introduction to TDD in Spring Boot (LinkedIn Learning)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/test-driven-development-in-spring-boot-with-junit-and-mockito/introduction-to-tdd-in-spring-boot).

Here‚Äôs the example test method I wrote:

```java
@Test
public void getAllCategoriesTest() {
    List<Category> expectedCategoryList = new ArrayList<>();
    expectedCategoryList.add(new Category(1, "charger", "A phone charger"));
    expectedCategoryList.add(new Category(2, "iphone", "An iPhone"));

    // Arrange
    when(categoryDao.getAllCategories()).thenReturn(expectedCategoryList);

    // Act
    List<Category> categoryList = controller.getAll();

    // Assert
    assertThat(categoryList)
        .isNotEmpty()
        .isEqualTo(expectedCategoryList)
        .hasSize(2);
}
```
